- **Significance:** By identifying key variables influencing house prices, the project enhances decision-making capabilities, ensuring informed investments.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** 3.12.2
- **Jupyter Notebook:** 7.4.2
- **Anaconda:** 2023.10
- **Libraries:**
  - **Numpy:** 1.26.2
  - **Pandas:** 2.1.4
  - **Plotly:** 5.18.0
  - **Matplotlib:** 3.6.2
  - **Seaborn:** 0.12.2
  - **Statsmodels:** 0.14.0
  - **Scikit-learn (Sklearn):** 1.2.0

## Objectives
- **Identify Significant Variables:** Determine features with statistically significant impacts on house prices using regression analysis.
- **Model Accuracy Assessment:** Evaluate the predictive performance of linear, polynomial, ridge, and lasso regression models.
- **Optimize Regularization Parameters:** Fine-tune lambda parameters for ridge and lasso models to achieve optimal predictive power.

## Modeling Approach
- **Data Preparation:** Cleaned and prepared the `train.csv` dataset provided by UpGrad, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
- **Visualization:** Visualized data patterns and insights to understand relationships between variables.
- **Model Building:**
  - Utilized Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to select relevant features for linear regression.
  - Applied polynomial regression (degree 2) and addressed overfitting with ridge and lasso regression techniques.
- **Model Validation:** Conducted residual analysis to validate model assumptions and ensure robustness across training and test datasets.

## Conclusions
- **Data Preparation:** Ensured dataset cleanliness and preparedness for accurate modeling.
- **Model Performance:** Developed robust regression models (linear, polynomial, ridge, lasso) validated through rigorous analysis.
- **Insights:** Derived actionable insights into Australian housing market dynamics, enabling strategic decision-making for Surprise Housing.
